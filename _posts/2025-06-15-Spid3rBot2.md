During our course Experimental Characterization of Materials we developed a deep understanding on different synthesis and characterization methods of materials. The theme was to create and characterize a carbon fiber plate doped with carbon nanoestructures in order to obtain supercapacitors by increasing the surface area in comparison with a flat surface.

A brief summary of this 5 week long and enriching project can be found in this page:

We gained first hands experience from constructing a solution of with Polyacrylonitirle (PAN), Dymethil Formamide (DMF) and Fe nanoparticles that act as a seed. This solution was then converted into nanofibers using the electrospinning method.

When a piece of the nanofiber mat was cut and place in a CVD furnase for pyrolisis and carbon deposition, we achieved carbon nanofibers with the objective to obtain carbon nanotubes growing from around the iron nanoparticles.

In the end, although we didnt obtain carbon nanotubes, we observed carbon nanoestructures which could increase further the surface area and improve the capacitors.

To fully characterize electrical conductivity in the absence of other contamintans, its dependance to temperature and possibly light, a custom vacuum chamber was designed with the following constrains:

It must had a maximum volume of 4 L
Was required to reach 3 x 10 ^-3 Torr
Could sweep from -150°C to 150°C
Allow to irradiate the sample with light of different wavelengths inside the visible spectrum
Make it the most cost effective alternative
Allow for a versatile of use



The vacuum chamber was designed on Fusion360 due to its range of operations and ease of use. The main body is thought to be made out of common water supply pipe sizes of Stainles Steel 304 to minimize outgassing and allow a cheap alternative.

The gaskets were carefully selected to allow vacuum levels to go even higher into the UHV regime. For these reason, only the ports that are thought to be opened frequently use a viton o-ring gasket, the rest have copper metal-metal-metal gaskets.

The most important component inside the system is the sample holder, it holds the 4 probes to accuretely measure electrical transport, thermocouples, structural support and electrical insulation for the sample. This was denominated the "Arc Component" for its resemblance to the arc reactor.

*Arc Component drawing*

In order to cool down the sample to -150°C, liquid nitrogen was used going through a coil surounding the sample holder. Since the measurements are thought to be made in vacuum, only thermal conductance and radiative effects were considered.

In the same way, a heating resistance cartridge was added at the back of the sample holder 

Finite Element Analysis and Heat transfer simulations were used to determine the relaibility of the Arc component, both as structural support and as a conductive system with the sample. 

The results of the simulations revealed that the temperature requirements were met, as well as that the Arc component wont experience plastical deformation unless it is exposed to more than 10kg of weight inside the chamber. Which in practice is not supossed to happen in normal conditions.
